This week, I managed to pass the intermediate test at Bazooka Joe kickboxing. I did not expect to fail since Joe himself recommended me to take it, but oh boy was I was overpreparring. It was my goal when I first joined this gym to get into intermediate. Now that it's done let's set some new goals.

Lets try and incorporate weight room back into the week. I havenâ€™t done barbell work since lockdown, so that should be fun. We will change jump rope every other day to add back in weight lifting. Shadowboxing is just fun for me, I can do that during downtimes/meetings so that's fine. I will try to go kickboxing 4 days a week. Very unrealistic with my business and day job, but let's make it a rule. If I ever have an open window and there is a class going on, I go. Schedule will look like this

Monday:  <br>

Shadow Box 3 Rounds of 5 Minutes <br>

Sunday: <br>

Body Weight exercise <br>

This is all very realistic and doable if I just had more time, Alias we are not rich enough to be financially independent yet so we have to make do. This is the gym aspect of it, let's also update the diet. 


145 Lbs  <br>
145g Protein  <br>
55g Fat <br>
215g Carbs <br>

(4*145)+(9*55)+(4*215) ~=  2000 calories daily <br>

Gain Weight <br>
145lb x 0.005 = 0.72 lbs per week <br>
extra 360 daily calorie surplus <br>

 I might look to lower my protein intake since I am not not powerlifting or anything. Weight gain is probably no longer needed since I do not wish to go down in cardio for martial arts. 


Martial Arts Goal

My ass is too old to fight in a professional fight, but bazooka joe does have in house tournaments. My next goal for stand up should be joining an in-house tournament or getting promoted to advanced classes. For brazilian Jiu Jitsu I would just say go constantly, I have been slacking in that department. Lets try and get 1 stripe by end of the year

Weight room Goal

These were my numbers before lockdown started 

155 3x5 squat.     160 3x3 <br>
135 3x5 bench.    145 5x1 <br>
175 3x5 deadlift <br>
80 3x5 oh press <br>


My body weight is 140-145. I guess I won't be powerlifting since martial arts is my focus. I think I should just do another strength program so I can get my newbie gains back, Then I'll transition to more reps? This is not my area of expertise. Will do more research and update.
