Many people aspire to be more compassionate. Treating others as we wish to be treated lies at the heart of many religious and spiritual traditions. However, we do not often extend that same courtesy to ourselves. We might even find that we are kinder to others than we are to ourselves. Why do you turn into your own worst critic and assume that if you treat yourself like crap, then this would motivate you to be better? When I started looking into this topic in my pursuit of FIRE, I started to realize that many people might be feeling these similar emotions everytime they fail regardless of their goals.

A pattern I have noticed among my peers is how they incorrectly in my opinion deal with failure. No matter how relatively small the mistake, as soon as it occurs, they become stressed, anxious and disconnected. They self-criticize themselves to a point where they become afraid of failure. I do wish to clarify that I am saying self-criticism doesn't work. People have sat through hours of me shitting on myself for failures and setbacks. Self-criticism definitely works, however, only as a slight negative motivator because of just how harshly you criticize yourself. Nobody likes getting criticized, even by yourself. You're kind of motivated to escape this type of self judgment. It's this fear and pressure that builds up every time you fail, making you more nervous and anxious to the point that you start self handicapping yourself. So on the chance that you do fail, you can avoid feeling like crap by blaming the failure on something else. This will lead to a point where to protect your self esteem, you don't even bother trying to avoid failure. This would become a self perpetuating cycle where you constantly never try and you never learn from your mistakes in fear of failure. 

Instead of just being a harsh critic to yourself, there's actually something else that people should do. It is called self-compassion. If a friend fails at something, what would you do to motivate them? It probably goes along the way of “it's okay, everyone fails. You can do better next time” which is the compassionate way of dealing with failure. If this works with other people, why do we treat ourselves so harshly? Countless studies show that self compassionate people are more likely to take action and reach their goals in life from dieting, smoking, finance, and even exercising. Self compassion is not about dismissing your failures and not trying anymore. Self compassion is similar to having your own personal coach or teacher who is firm, holds you to a high standard, but also helps you reach your goals.

Self compassion is something I have been successfully practicing for a long time. I guess it’s just something you develop subconsciously in certain conditions growing up. As the youngest child of a slightly above-poverty immigrant family, failure has never been something out of the ordinary. Expecting failure has been so conditioned in my brain since youth that nothing really surprises me anymore. One of the biggest chain of failures actually occurred pretty recently. It started with my crackhead tenants finding out it was impossible for me to evict them during covid so they stopped paying rent. It’s not like the banks cared about tenant issues, so I was still responsible for paying the mortgage. They also made it their job to destroy the property as much as possible which would be a future problem for me. In the same couple of months, my smart ass lost close to six figures from daytrading in the stock market. I knew all the risk, but I was arrogant and inexperienced and it burned me. Also in the same couple months, I also got laid off from my full-time developer position because of covid losing a good portion of my annual income. Lastly in the same month, my aging mother had a life threatening situation that sent her to the ICU for a month during peak covid lockdown. It was a very frustrating and scary month, as ICU had a whole list of covid protocols. The ripples of this single event still affected me greatly as it really changed my perspective and my priorities in life. All these misfortunes occurred in the span of 1-2 months. I remember sitting next to my mother in the ICU emergency room, practicing for tech interviews, pondering how to get my rental property back and brainstorming ways to earn enough money to pay for the future renovation. Knowing myself, I was definitely frustrated and falling prey to self-criticism. I would assume events like this happening consecutively would overwhelm a lot of people throwing them into a downward spiral. However, from the position I am in now, I believe I passed these failures with flying colors. What kind of mindset would you need to get through them?

I imagine myself on a wagon, on the road of life striving towards my goals. Everytime I failed, I would fall off the wagon and drop into the mud. Falling off the wagon hurts, but for me, the falling part is not the real problem. The real problem happens with how I respond to falling. Do I decide to get back on the wagon and keep going or just lay there in the mud? Life is suffering, failure will always happen in life just like me falling off the wagon. No matter how many times I get knocked down or I screw up, I will always get up and try again. My practice of self compassion allowed me to learn from my mistakes, to take more action, and to keep getting back on the wagon.  We all want to reach our goals in life as quickly as possible. We all want to fast forward to the end result. But the reality is most likely it's going to take years and years of hard work. Self compassion will help you make sure that you don't give up in between those years. 

Study after study shows that self-criticism doesn't create an environment that fosters high performance and improvement. It creates fear and which in turn makes it harder to work towards your goals. Compassion, on the other hand, helps you get serious about your growth and gets you closer to your goals.
