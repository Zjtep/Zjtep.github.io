People close to me know I read a lot during my freetime. They would ask me to recommend books on certain topics and I feel when I get put on the spot, I could not give them a good answer.

Here is a dump of all the books that have caught my attention. Note: I have not started reading all of these, nor have I finished most of them. Even the onesI have finished reading, I would still need to reread them to fully understand. This list is simply a list of different topics that interested me over the years. This list isn’t updated in any way, but there is plenty of material here to get started. Hit me up if you want to discuss anything or want to know what I am currently reading
