People close to me know I enjoy reading a lot during my freetime. They would ask me to recommend books on certain topics and I feel when I get put on the spot, I could not give them a good answer.
Here is a list I compiled of some of my favorites over the years. There are also some in here that I still have to finish and reread to really understand. This list isn’t updated in any way and will most likely be different by the time you read this, but there is plenty of material here for you to get started. Hit me up if you want to know what I am currently reading.
