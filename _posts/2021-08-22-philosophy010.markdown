For me, mental toughness is seeing the good in everything. Even if something catastrophic occurs and shit hits the fan, you only see the good because there is good in all bad events. If tomorrow a doctor tells me I'm going to die from cancer in six months, well I get to tell myself, I’m going to live at another level in these six months because I know my days are numbered. So every day for me is going to be like a year. Every second is going to be like hours for me because I'm going to appreciate it that much more. There has to be something positive in whatever happens. 
 
A person I look up to is Marcus Aurelius. He is one of the best leaders that Rome ever had. He was the emperor of Rome at the height of its power. His reign was full of tragedies; Parthata invading him from the east,  Germanic tribes invading from the North, Plague hit his whole kingdom, his children died at young age, and his friend started a rebellion. He wrote journals during his time in war and he explained your thoughts are the dye you soak your mind in and how you see the world. Somebody who sees the positive in everything, you have to kill them to beat them. No matter how hard and low you put them, if there is ever a spark, he still believes he can climb to the top. When somebody sees the negative and they start convincing themselves it's over, that person can be beaten. They already beat themselves. In my time in business, I realize really quickly that you are operating without a safety net. It can all go away tomorrow if something catastrophic happens. The thing I have to alway focus on is that spark of hope, no matter how low I go, I believe I can rise back up.    

It's an incredibly important core component because once you're depressed inside, it becomes a downward spiral of negativity. You can never let yourself have negative emotions for a prolonged period of time. Marcus Aurelius also says that whenever you lose your off balance emotionally, see how fast you can bring yourself back to being positive. Bad things were happening to him left and right, but he would bring himself back to being center.  That's the worst person to face. If that's your enemy, no matter what you throw out of him, he will never go away. He'll never quit. In his mind, it's going to work out in the end, somehow, some way. I look around me all the time and I see people who are down and out and then come back to make it. This can be found everywhere in corporations, martial artists, business people etc These people see a bad situation as temporary. 

The one book I always recommend to people the most is “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People” The first habit the book talks about is “Being Proactive” instead of reactive. A reactive person would always find something else to blame for issues that arise. Oh you're late for a job interview, well that was the traffic’s fault and not mine. A proactive person makes zero excuses. He's not going to wait for somebody to come save him. He is going to take responsibility for his life and not blame circumstances. He is in control of his behavior.
