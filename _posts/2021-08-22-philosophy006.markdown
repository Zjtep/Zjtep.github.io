Soren Kierkegaard -  Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced 

In life we face many challenges. Everyone in this world is experiencing some sort of challenge. These challenges will make us become stronger or weaker. I believe those people who do not lose hope and grind through these issues, will surely have a better and brighter future. These challenges will define us who we are. Grind through everything because life is a gift that we should enjoy every second of. We should enjoy and never take for granted every little thing. No matter how hard the situation is we need to face the reality and at the end of the day we become happy. In reality, yes there is no perfect life. But I believe that it is in our hands the solution on how to make it the best. We only have one life to live. Life is like a battle we need to fight for and to win. Life is an adventure that we must pursue every day and an experience we must strive to achieve. They give this life because we have a purpose that is to enjoy our life and live it to the fullest.
