I finally got around to documenting this personal project of mine I worked on for most of 2021. Long story short, I ended up acquiring a run-down crack house that needed major renovations. The skillset needed to tackle such a project was well above mine back then. However, I didn't want to lose such a massive learning opportunity.  What you see here is the end result of many trials and errors. With the amount of work I see, this would be by far my most ambitious restoration. Here is my full journey.

Here are photos of the house before the crackheads took over. It was an older style house that would lack the appeal for a modern buyer.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_03.JPG" caption="The living room(to the left) and the kitchen(right) were seperated with their own entrance ways. This house was modified to also include a half bathroom in the kitchen(not their brightest ideas as IMO that brings negative value)." width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_05.jpg" caption="Why is this even here between the living room and the kitchen? Not only is it out of place, but it also messes with the layout to cause further cramping." width=900 align="center" %}

Here are photos of the house after the crackheads had their run by.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_70.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

Needless to say, I had my work cut out for me. This place was disgusting. The first order of business regardless of what I decide to do with the house is to clean it

Once I have gotten a full look at the house after the cleanup, I decided the best course of action would be to take the house to the twentieth century. Let's get started on the demolition!

Now with the house fully gutted, we can finally do the renovation.

Let's look at task which I think is the order of operations

    -Update plumbing in the basement for new bathroom + new location for washer/dryer
    -Framing out another bathroom for the basement
    -Update electrical switches for the hous
    -Install pot lights for modern concept
    -Cut open main floor walls for open-concept
    -Reinforce the main floor with beams
    -Remove old carport to allow more light into the house
    -New windows and doors
    -Drywall the house
    -Mud the Drywall
    -Prime the house for painting
    -Hardwood flooring for main and rooms
    -Vinyl flooring for basement
    -Stairs
    -Install shower/bathtub/vanity/toilet  for two bathrooms
    -Tile bathrooms

Remove the ugly car port.

New windows and doors.

Free scrap metal :)

We needed to divide up the laundry room for a new bathroom to replace the one in the living room we demoed. This requires rerouting of plumbing and framing.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_50.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

With the layout all set up, let's put some skin back on.  electrical(pot lights) + drywall + mudding
