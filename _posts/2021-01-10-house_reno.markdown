Long story short, I came in possession of a run-down crackhouse. I had two options, sell it as it is and take a massive opportunity loss through a contractor flipping my property, or fully restore the house.
With the amount of work I see, this would be by far my most ambitious restoration. Here is my full journey.

Here are photos of the house before the crackheads took over. From the beginning, the house already had its flaws.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_03.JPG" caption="Walls plus door separating the living room from the stairs to the kitchen? Much too cramped for any modern house." width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_02.JPG" caption="The kitchen is too small for the amount of area in the room. Note that random bathroom next to the kitchen. wtf?" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_05.jpg" caption="Who the hell modified the house to have a bathroom between the living room and the kitchen on the main floor? wut. It is out of place AND it adds more walls to further cramp the layout" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_04.jpg" caption="The living room shouldn't be walled off like this in modern home" width=900 align="center" %}

Here are photos of the house after the crackheads had their run by.

Needless to say, I had my work cut out for me. First order of business clean the house.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_26.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

Once the garbage was out, We needed to do demolition on the whole house. I have already decided on a full gut rebuild to modernized the house

{% include image.html url="/images/house_30.jpg" caption="Demo that weirdly placed washroom." width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_33.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_34.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_35.jpg" caption="We need to tear down these walls for a more open concept." width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_36.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_38.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

Now with the house fully gutted, we can finally do the renovation. Lets start with the low hanging fruit. Foundational changes for a more open-concept.
