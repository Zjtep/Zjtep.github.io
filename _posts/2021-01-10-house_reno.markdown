I finally got around to documenting this personal project of mine I worked on for most of 2021. Long story short, I ended up acquiring a run-down crack house that needed major renovations. The skillset needed to tackle such a project was well above mine back then. However, I didn't want to lose such a massive learning opportunity.  What you see here is the end result of many trials and errors. With the amount of work I see, this would be by far my most ambitious restoration. Here is my full journey.

Here are photos of the house before the crackheads took over. It was an older style house that would lack the appeal for a modern buyer.

Needless to say, I had my work cut out for me. This place was disgusting. The first order of business regardless of what I decide to do with the house is to clean it

Once I have gotten a full look at the house after the cleanup, I decided the best course of action would be to take the house to the twentieth century. Let's get started on the demolition!

Now with the house fully gutted, we can finally do the renovation.

Let's look at task which I think is the order of operations

    -Update plumbing in the basement for new bathroom + new location for washer/dryer
    -Framing out another bathroom for the basement
    -Update electrical switches for the house
    -Install pot lights for modern concept
    -Cut open main floor walls for open-concept
    -Reinforce the main floor with beams
    -Remove old carport to allow more light into the house
    -New windows and doors
    -Drywall the house
    -Mud the Drywall
    -Prime the house for painting
    -Hardwood flooring for main and rooms
    -Vinyl flooring for basement
    -Stairs
    -Install shower/bathtub/vanity/toilet  for two bathrooms
    -Tile bathrooms
    -Finish paint
    -Install kitchen
    -Yard work

Since we demoed the living room bathroom for more space, I needed to add another full bathroom somewhere. We chose the basement laundry area. However, in order to make a bathroom the plumbing needed to be changed. Moreover, the old electrical panel was in that room and it is by law that we cannot put an electrical panel inside a bathroom. we needed to frame out a new room.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_51.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_50.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

We needed to update the electrical of the house and install pot lights to the main and bedroom floors. 

{% include image.html url="/images/house_46.jpg" caption="Pot lights in" width=900 align="center" %}

The main floor still had the original farming of the old walls. I wanted an open concept so those had to go. However, that would mess with the structure of the building. We had to brace and reinforce it before we can cut them.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_91.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

The old carport was outdated and blocked a lot of sunlight from coming in through the east window. It was rotten as well and would be a waste to fix. We had to remove it.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_94.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_43.jpg" caption="Much more sunlight" width=900 align="center" %}

The crackheads made it their job to break all the windows and doors. We needed to replace them.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_49.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

With the structural and the layout of the house fixed to standard, it's time to add back on the skin. Drywall and mudding are next.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_57.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_59.jpg" caption="" width=900 align="center" %}

With all the drywall in, we had a chance to prime the house for paint. We also finally had room to get all the floorboards/vinal/vanity/toilet/stairs

{% include image.html url="/images/house_60.jpg" caption="Tiles for bathrooms/vanity/floor trimmings" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_61.jpg" caption="walls primed + pile of stuff" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_79.jpg" caption="walls primed + pile of stuff" width=900 align="center" %}

With the primer in, We had a chance to work on the flooring, tiling, and stairs. Since the house isn't too big,  I went pretty standard and went with white. The most popular shade of white is chantilly lace so that's what I picked. A house has to have a complimenting accented color.  We went with a light grey since it goes very well with white. It's a pretty generic combination and I was hoping this house would appeal to a wider audience.
