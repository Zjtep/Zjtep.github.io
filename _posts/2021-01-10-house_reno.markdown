Long story short, I came in possession of a run-down crackhouse. I had two options, sell it as it is and take a massive opportunity loss through a contractor flipping my property, or fully restore the house.
With the amount of work I see, this would be by far my most ambitious restoration. Here is my full journey.

Here are photos of the house before the crackheads took over. From the beginning, the house already had its flaws.

{% include image.html url="/images/house_06.jpg" caption="The front door leads to a dark hall, with a smaller house, this does nothing for it. " width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_03.JPG" caption="Walls plus door separating the living room from the stairs to the kitchen? Much too cramped for any modern house." width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_02.JPG" caption="The kitchen is too small for the amount of area in the room. Note that random bathroom next to the kitchen. wtf?" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_05.jpg" caption="Who the hell modified the house to have a bathroom between the living room and the kitchen on the main floor? wut. It is out of place AND it adds more walls to further cramp the layout" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_04.jpg" caption="The living room shouldn't be walled off like this in modern home" width=900 align="center" %}

{% include image.html url="/images/house_07.jpg" caption="storm drain was not set up correctly. " width=900 align="center" %}
