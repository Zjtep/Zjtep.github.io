I can't even count the number of times I facepalmed when I hear people talking about their TFSA and RRSP accounts. This is a dumbass's guide to these two accounts. If you have this link, most likely you were saying something really stupid many many times to a point where it was enough for me to finally feel like I should correct you. Every year during tax season I get bombarded with the same questions like How much should I contribute to my RRSP? Wouldn't it make sense for me to contribute to my RRSP because I wanna lower my tax bracket?  Should I still prioritize TFSA over RRSP? What are you doing, can I just copy? Try and read and understand this and then ask me questions. Furthermore, this is not financial advice. All this is from my perspective, experience, and research as a young Canadian. Please do your own research before saying Johnny told you to yolo on SHIBA.


"What is a TFSA account?"


Think of your TFSA as a magic box. You only have 1 of these boxes your entire life. Every bank or institution that offers TFSA services is ALL linked to the same box. so say you have a TFSA account with wealth simple and a TFSA account with CIBC, it's just a proxy going into the same TFSA account. This box is magic. Anything placed inside this TFSA box will grow faster than it would outside of the box. This is because inside the box there is no tax. So say Spongebob put $100 in a TFSA box with a 10 percent interest rate a year. After one year, Spongebob might have $110 because he didn't get taxed on the gains. If Spongebob puts that same $100 outside of a TFSA, the $10 gained will be taxed, so you get maybe $7 instead of $10.


You can put lots of different things inside the box, it’s entirely up to you, but we normally prefer to put things inside the box that grow big and grow fast. So this would inlcude savings account, a GIC, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, index ETFs etc. Anything inside the TFSA will grow tax free. This is a big advantage over time. So we would prefer to use our TFSA for investments that grow fast and could incur a lot of tax.


Every year the magic box naturally grows larger. Each year on January 1st, the magic box grows a bit larger so that you can put more stuff inside the box. So every year on January 1st, the amount you can put into this box grows by $6,000 (this changes sometimes)


You can take things out of the box at any time, but you can only put things into the box if there is room. So if you have $5000 in your TFSA, you can take it out anytime you want tax-free. There is no penalty for taking money out


So what have we learned? A TFSA is a magic box that contains all your investments and everything that grows in it is tax-free. As long as there is room inside the box, it would probably be in your best interest to fill it entirely since it's tax-free.


"What is a RRSP account?"


The RRSP is also a magic box. You also only have 1 of these boxes your entire life. Every bank or institution that offers RRSP services is ALL linked to the same box. so say you have a RRSP account with wealth simple and a RRSP account with CIBC, it's just a proxy going into the same RRSP account.


If you put things into this RRSP box, you get a kickback on taxes that would have been charged to you if you placed those things outside of the box. If a contribution is made with post-tax income then you’ll get your tax back at the end of the year. So you know that money you get from your day job? that is counts as post-tax money because Uncle Sam already took his cut as soon as you get your paycheck. If you contribute to an RRSP,  you will get whatever Uncle Sam took depending on your tax bracket.


Everything you put into the TFSA can also be put into an RRSP.  So this would inlcude savings account, a GIC, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, index ETFs etc.


You can take things out of the RRSP box at any time without penalty. However, as soon as you take the money out, you will get taxed on it again. This withholding tax is just a pre-payment of your annual taxes, it's not a penalty.


RRSP accounts help you defer tax, you won’t avoid tax all together, you just defer tax until retirement. This is why RRSPs are especially popular with high income individuals. They can defer tax until retirement when they’re in a lower tax rate.
