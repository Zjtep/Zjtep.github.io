I finally got around to documenting this personal project of mine I worked on for most of 2021. Long story short, I ended up acquiring a run-down crack house that needed major renovations. The skillset needed to tackle such a project was well above mine back then. However, I didn't want to lose such a massive learning opportunity.  What you see here is the end result of many trials and errors. With the amount of work I see, this would be by far my most ambitious restoration. Here is my full journey.

Here are photos of the house before the crackheads took over. It was an older style house that would lack the appeal for a modern buyer.
