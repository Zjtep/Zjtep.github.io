In my time studying Aristotle philosophy, I came across the term “Eudemonia” as the ultimate form of human achievement. The definition of Eudemoniais a life of Eudemonia is a life of striving. It’s a life of pushing yourself to your limits, and finding success. A eudaimonistic life will be full of happiness that comes from achieving something really difficult rather than just having it handed to you. This really to me felt very similar to the Buddhist concept of achieving Nirvana. I had to do some research to see what the difference was. It is truly a wonder when wisdom from the East(Aristotle) and the West(Buddhism) arrive at the same conclusion. According to Buddhism, anyone who wishes to attain Nirvana must practice and develop Discipline (Morality), Concentration and Wisdom. There is no other path to Nirvana than developing these three fundamentals. But they are all interlinked and must be practiced, not one by one, but together. I remember these Discipline (Morality), Concentration and Wisdom were the 8-fold paths of Buddhism and to achieve all 8, you have reached Nirvana. If Eudaimonia is defined as human flourishing, the difference is that Nirvana is the realization that human is just a word appearing to mind and not more than that. Nirvana is more of a state of mind. You could be chilling in the Bahamas but you could STILL be in a state of Nirvana. Eudaimonia does seem very similar to Nirvana, but I guess from my understanding, it's kind of like a subset of it. Where to achieve Nirvana, you must have also acheived Eudaimonia. In any case, we know what is the most desirable state: it is the enlightened nature of one’s mind, that which ensures security and creates common benefit, wisdom and harmony (as opposed to ignorance and sufferings).
