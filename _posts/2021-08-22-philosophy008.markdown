In Christianity, there is a quote which states “Idle hands are the devil’s workshop” If one does not immerse themselves with constructive activity, they may lean toward laziness, non-productiveness and trouble. Meanwhile, when people do have a purpose or a cause that’s greater than themselves, they will start to align themselves and modify their character and lifestyle to achieve it.

The biggest depression of my life occured when I reached age 23. It was the year I graduated and got my first full time job as a software developer. As a second generation immigrant, I have just accomplished a major milestone. The cookie cutter format of getting good grades(lolz), going to university, graduating and starting a career was finished. I would like to add, I’m very aware of how lucky I am. I got a good degree in a highly developing field. I wasn’t the most passionate student in my program and I could never measure up to the ‘genius’ types. However, I did enjoy a majority of my classes and had a very fun time.

As I started settling into my career, I slowly started to realize what I actually signed up for. Even as of writing this, I still have never developed any passion for any of my salaried positions. I’m perfectly capable of doing most of the work that gets assigned to me without needing much help but it all feels so soulless. I don’t really care about what or how well my company is doing as long as my team and I don’t get laid off. I’ve never felt compelled to contribute anything except exactly what’s asked of me. I feel like I’m stagnating but there’s nothing in these giant corporations that I really want to do or learn. I always had a passion for technology and programming, but now that I’ve made it a career, I feel like it’s draining all my energy. 

I did not know it at the time, but I have lost purpose in life. Outside of my career, my free time that used to be filled with activity just changed to playing games and depression naps. Everyday felt like the same thing: I would wake up, go to work, commute home, eat, sleep and repeat. There is still a long way to go until retirement age at 65. Despite my poor state of mind, I continued to advance my career through pay raises and job changes. However, no amount of money or changes in corporations could fill the void of dissatisfaction. 

Looking back at the time now, I was too ashamed, embarrassed, arrogant or proud to seek advice outright. My inner circle at the time I felt did not have any solutions to my issues. My immigrant asain parents thought I was just being too soft and privileged. My elder brother who was always my inspiration and meteor growing up I felt could not help here. He seems perfectly content working his day job. In fact, a majority of people I knew either accepted their fate or did not seem to mind the endless grind of the rat race. Have I really reached my pinnacle and would continue this path for the next 40 years?

In movies, there would also be some sort of super dramatic event which will trigger the evolution of the protagonist. For me, that event was not as dramatic. At a party I stumbled onto a person who projected an aura that was very different compared to everyone I knew. This person was older than me, but his life experience was miles ahead of his age. This person seems to be knowledgeable about every single topic like he has done it before. He spoke with confidence, without being arrogant. He was assertive without being reckless. He lived a very disciplined life, but somehow he seemed so free. This person I would later find out was an entrepreneur. I would end up speaking with this person for the entire night. He explained to me about different ways to escape my current mindset. He spoke about different businesses I can go into with my skill set. He would eventually set the seeds in motion where I would eventually find out it was called the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement. The aim of this movement was to accumulate enough money to eventually be free of depending on a regular job. The more I listened and later read into it the more I was hooked. Suddenly there was a light at the end of the hole. There was a way to finally break those golden handcuffs. My new purpose was simple: How do I earn enough money to be Financially Free?

The more I hung out and shadowed my new mentor, the more I was inspired to improve myself to be as successful as he is. There were plenty of resources out there. I started studying philosophy and different kinds of religion. I read so many self-development books that any new one I pick up feels the same. The books I felt were good, I would write notes and reread the paragraphs to truly comprehend the knowledge. Knowledge is power but knowledge without action is useless. Just like a person who reads about exercising and never actually goes to the gym, I needed to rewire my brain to truly embrace and utilize this information in my lifestyle. Aristotle said your character is developed through habituation - if you do a virtuous thing over and over again, eventually it will become part of character. Slowly but surely, I would change and evolve my mindset and lifestyle to be a person capable of achieving my new goal.

Parallel to my self-improvement, I needed to actually start learning about finance. Even before this, I naturally lived well below my means. I also had a high paying salary so I managed to save a lot of money already. Like self-development I started reading every finance book I could find. I began experimenting in investments and opening small businesses. Even to run these smaller scale operations successfully it would require me to practice many transferable  skills that I would use in later larger operations. Highly desirable soft skills were put into practice like communication, negotiations, management, leadership, risk management etc. Hard skills like accounting, Canadian laws, taxes, web design, SEO, import/export goods, graph analysis, house renovation were all put into practice. As some of these businesses and investments naturally failed, I stopped seeing failure as a bad thing, but just an opportunity to grow. 

As I naturally self-improved, so did my finances. I started doing larger investments and businesses. The same negotiation and risk management skills I practiced with flipping laptops were used to flip larger assets. The programming skills I had were put up for sale for consulting, personal projects and free-lance gigs. I am naturally a very introverted person, so I very rarely reveal anything to anybody except my closest circles. However, as I maneuvered through these new waters, like minded people started to notice. It's just human nature that like-minded people naturally gravitate towards each other.My inner circle started filling up with other FIRE seekers and business minded people. People that had no idea of what I was doing, took notice of my positive changes and would reach out for advice. I believe confidence is like a snowball going downhill. It will start off small on top of the hill, but as it rolls down it grows and grows. I became a highly effective AI that keeps improving and growing.

As I am approaching FIRE, I soon realized I might one day end up in the same position I was when first accepted that job. Will I sink straight back to a life of no purpose when my FIRE goal is finished? There is a saying in Buddhism, “Before Enlightenment chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water” What this quote is saying is before enlightenment, you hate your life. You chop wood and carry water, but secretly wish to get out of it all. You bear with these activities through habit and out of hopelessness, but you really wish you could do something else. After Enlightenment, you realized the emptiness of it all, so you see that there is nothing more important than chopping wood and carrying water. All activities are equalized, there is no preference, no discrimination. Because there is no “you”, no ego, no personality, no being, no separate individuality - there is no conflict. No need to escape. You have mastered your mind. This Journey to FIRE has taught me so many things from such a wide range of topics. My desire for self-improvement will continue well after I achieve FIRE. The topic of finance might be replaced with something else, but the person that first started the journey has matured. The world is a very large place and with FIRE, it opens me to pursue a whole range of subjects. One thing is clear, I will never lose purpose in life again.
