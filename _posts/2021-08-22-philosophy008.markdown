In Christianity, there is a quote which states “Idle hands are the devil's workshop” If one does not immerse themselves with constructive activity, they may lean toward laziness, non-productiveness and trouble. Meanwhile, when people do have a purpose or a cause that’s greater than themselves, they will start to align themselves and modify their character to achieve it. 

The biggest depression of my life occured when I reached age 23. It was the year I graduated and got my first full time job as a software developer. As a second generation immigrant, I just accomplished a major milestone. The cookie cutter format of getting good grades(lolz), going to university, graduating and getting a high paying career was done. I’m very aware of how lucky I am. I got a good degree. I wasn’t the most passionate student in my program and I never measured up to the ‘genius’ types. But I managed to graduate and had an okay time.

As I started settling into my career, I slowly started to realize what I actually signed up for. I still have never developed any passion for any of my salaried positions. I'm perfectly capable of doing most of the work that gets assigned to me without needing much help but it all feels so soulless.  I don't really care about what or how well my company is doing as long as me and my team don't get laid off, I've never felt compelled to contribute anything except exactly what's asked of me.I feel like I'm stagnating but there's nothing in these giant corporations that I want to learn and there's nothing I really want to do here. I always had a passion for technology and programming, but now that I’ve made it a career, I feel like it's draining all my energy. Outside of my career, my free time that used to be filled with hobbies and interests just changed to playing games and depression naps. 

I did not know it at the time, but I have lost purpose in life. Everyday felt like the same thing: I would wake up, go to work, go home, eat, sleep and repeat. There is still a long way to go until age 65. Am I really going to spend the next 40+ years doing this? People I knew complained about similar issues, but none of them were depressed because of it. Why were they content with such a fate but I yearned for something more. 

During my low point, at a party I stumbled on a person who projected an aura that was very different compared to everyone I knew. This person was older than me, but his life experience was miles ahead of his age. This person seems to be knowledgeable about every single topic like he has done it before. He spoke with confidence, without being arrogant. He was assertive without being reckless. He lived a very disciplined life, but somehow he seemed so free. This person I would later find out was an entrepreneur. I would end up speaking with this person for the entire night. He explained to me about different ways to escape this depression. He spoke about different businesses I can go into with my skill set. He set the seeds in motion where I would eventually find out it was called the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement. The aim of this movement was to accumulate enough money to eventually be free of depending on a regular job. The more I read into it the more I was hooked. Suddenly there was a light at the end of the hole. There was a way to finally break those golden handcuffs.  My new purpose was simple: How do I earn enough money to be Financially Free?

The more I hung out and shadowed my new mentor, the more I was inspired to improve myself to be as successful as he is. There were plenty of resources out there. I started studying philosophy and different kinds of religion. I read so many self-development books that any new one I pick up feels the same. Knowledge is power but knowledge without action is useless. Just like a person who reads about exercising and never actually goes to the gym, I needed to rewire my brain to truly embrace the lifestyle of these teachings. Aristotle said your character is developed through habituation - if you do a virtuous thing over and over again, eventually it will become part of character. I started modifying my character to achieve my goal.

Parallel to my self-development, I needed to actually start learning about finance. I naturally lived well within my means and had a high paying salary so I had a lot of savings already. Like self-development I started reading every finance book I could find. I began experimenting in smaller scale investments and businesses. I don’t see failures as a bad thing, but the opportunity to grow. Every smaller scale operation required me to learn more and more skills that were transferable. Highly desirable skills like negotiations, leadership, risk taking, customer service etc were picked up despite some of my investments or businesses failing. As I naturally self-improved, so did my finances. I started doing larger investments and businesses. Like minded people started seeing what I was accomplishing and joined me on my journey. I believe confidence is like a snowball going downhill. It will start off small on top of the hill, but as it rolls down it grows and grows. I became a highly effective AI that keeps improving


As I am approaching FIRE, I soon realized I might one day end up in the same position I was when I got my first full time job. Will I again fall into a depressed state since I would lose purpose again? There is a saying in Buddhism, “Before Enlightenment chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water”  What this quote is saying is before enlightenment, you hate your life. You chop wood and carry water, but secretly wish to get out of it all. You bear with these activities through habit and out of hopelessness, but you really wish you could do something else. After Enlightenment, you realized the emptiness of it all, so you see that there is nothing more important than chopping wood and carrying water. All activities are equalized, there is no preference, no discrimination. Because there is no "you", no ego, no personality, no being, no separate individuality - there is no conflict. No need to escape. You have mastered your mind. This Journey to FIRE has taught me so many things from such a wide range of topics. My desire for self-improvement will continue well after I achieve FIRE. The topic of finance might be replaced with something else, but the person that first started the journey has grown. The world is a very large place and with FIRE, it opens me to pursue a whole range of subjects. One thing is clear, I will never lose purpose in life again.
