In Christianity, there is a quote which states “Idle hands are the devil's workshop” If one does not immerse themselves with constructive activity, they may lean toward laziness, non-productiveness and trouble. Meanwhile, when people do have a purpose or a cause that’s greater than themselves, they will start to align themselves and modify their character to achieve it. 

The biggest depression of my lifetime did not hit until I reached age 23. It was the year I graduated and got my first full time job as a software developer. Suddenly, The cookie cutter format of getting good grades(lolz), going to university, graduating and getting a career was done. I did not understand why I was depressed. I was at a high salary position many people would be envious of, but somehow I felt unfulfilled. I did not know it at the time, but I have lost purpose in life. The goal my parents set forth since I started kindergarten was finished and I was lost. Everyday felt like the same thing: I would wake up, go to work, go home, enjoy meaningless pleasures, eat, sleep and repeat. There is still a long way to go until age 65. Am I really going to spend the next 40+ years doing this? People I knew complained about similar issues, but none of them were depressed because of it. Why were they content with such a fate but I yearned for something more.

During my low point, at a party I stumbled on a person who projected an aura that was very different compared to everyone I knew. This person was older than me, but his life experience was miles ahead of his age. This person seems to be knowledgeable about every single topic like he has done it before. He spoke with confidence, but there was never any ego or bragging in his tone. This person I would later find out was an entrepreneur. I would end up speaking with this person the entire night. He explained about different ways to escape the rat race. He spoke about different businesses I can go into with my skill set. He set the seeds in motion where I would eventually find out it was called the  Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement. The aim is to save enough money to give them the freedom they want and avoid depending on a regular job to pay the bills. The more I read into it the more I was hooked. Suddenly there was a light at the end of the hole. I had a purpose again, How do I earn enough money to be Financially Free in Toronto.

I believe confidence is like a snowball going downhill. It will start off small on top of the hill, but as it rolls down it grows and grows. I started picking up every single finance that was recommended to me. I read so many self-development books that any new one I pick up feels the same. I started educating myself on the topics which I would need to build my empire. However, I knew just reading these topics was not enough, you still had to do it. Just like there is a difference between reading about working out and going to an actual gym, I had to rewire my brain and modify my lifestyle. I experimented with everything. From playing in the stock market, consulting. Freelance work, businesses, real estate, creating passive income streams, nothing was off the table. For every topic I dove into regardless of the outcome, I took it as a learning opportunity. Every investment opportunity I would walk away with more transferable skills which I carried onto the next project.  

As I approached FIRE, I soon realized I might one day end up in the same position I was when I got my first full time job. Will I again fall into a depressed state since I would lose purpose again? There is a saying in Buddhism, “Before Enlightenment chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water”  Before Enlightenment, you hate your life. You chop wood and carry water, but secretly wish to get out of it all. You bear with these activities through habit and out of hopelessness, but you really wish you could do something else. After Enlightenment, you realized the emptiness of it all, so you see that there is nothing more important than chopping wood and carrying water. All activities are equalized, there is no preference, no discrimination. Because there is no "you", no ego, no personality, no being, no separate individuality - there is no conflict. No need to escape. No other bank to be reached, no Nirvana to seek. But also, because you have mastered your mind, you are not chopped by the wood and carried by the water anymore. You can flip your perspective at will. It is your choice to chop wood and carry water, and you live it in complete suchness and spontaneity. This Journey to FIRE has taught me so many things from such a wide range of topics. The biggest being my curious personality and my desire for self-improvement. With these two traits even after I finally hit FIRE, I would never fall into depression again because of lack of purpose. There are simply too many subjects in this world I wish to learn and experience.
