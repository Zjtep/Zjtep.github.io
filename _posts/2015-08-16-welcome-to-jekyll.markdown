When the world needs some nice hello, you can come here. 

"Hello World!";

The Art of Code

The first thing every computer programmer learns is how to show "Hello World!" on the computer screen. The title of this exhibition reflects these details: the title starts with double quotes; this establishes the following text as a string to be displayed on the screen and it is not something that the computer is supposed to do. Following the quotes is the text: in this case, "Hello World!". The second set of double quotes ends the string and tells the computer only to display what is between the quotes. The semi-colon at the end of the phrase establishes this as a command to be carried out.
