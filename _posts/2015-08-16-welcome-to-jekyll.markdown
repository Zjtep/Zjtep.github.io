I love this quote from Plato “The greatest wealth is to live content with little”. At face value basic understanding, it just states how life is just so much more complicated and stressful when owning a lot of material. Obviously this quote isn’t talking about basic living essentials, it is simply referring to excess material. All these extra material possessions have little in value or do not cause long-term happiness. Oh, you have a Ferrari? Well, we are in Canada, so you better have a garage to store it in because of the snow and salt. You have a big mansion full of luxury goods? Well you better have good security to prevent thievery. 

That would be the basic understanding, where I am just comparing wealth as just material possessions. An even deeper understanding of this quote would be the “wealth” Plato talks about isn’t just material. It could also go beyond the material like power, fame, clout etc. These sorts of desires are difficult to satisfy because they are limitless. Even if you acquire “wealth”, you can always desire more. I have always wondered about my financial freedom journey; Would I actually stop when I hit that FIRE number? or will be like many capitalists, continue on and accumulate wealth until I can’t anymore. Hopefully, when that day comes I will continue my principles and stick to my simple lifestyle.
 
For me, living a simple life, with few possessions is the best. If you are living a simple life you will know how to value every single thing. You will know how to identify what is important in your life like you would first consider the thing that you need rather than what you want. A lifestyle creep will simply mean I need to start earning more to maintain it. All for what? More junk that I have to worry about. We want things in life because we think that they will bring us happiness. The problem is they only bring us temporary happiness, but nothing long-lasting.
