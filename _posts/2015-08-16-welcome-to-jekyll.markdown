I agree and love this quote of Plato “The greatest wealth is to live content with little”. At face value, life is just so much more complicated and stressful when owning a lot of material. All these extra material possessions we have to stress about and protect when they bring little value to our happiness. Oh, you have a Ferrari? Well, we are in Canada, so you better have a garage to house it.You would also need all these extra insurances to make sure it's protected. So for me living a simple life is better. If you are living a simple life you will know how to value every single thing. You will know how to identify what is important in your life like you would first consider the thing that you need rather than what you want. 

That is just at face value, where I am just comparing material possessions to happiness. In order to achieve these higher and higher tier possessions, you have to start earning more to keep up with your new lifestyle. So not only are you extra stressed with worrying about your new possessions, you are trading more of your time and effort to earn more money for stuff that in the grand scheme does not do anything.  We want things in life because we think that they will bring us happiness. The problem is they only bring us temporary happiness, but nothing long-lasting.

An even deeper understanding of this quote would be the wealth Plato talks about isn’t just material possessions. It could also go beyond the material like power,fame, clout etc. These sorts of desires are difficult to satisfy because they are limitless. Even if you acquire “wealth”, you can always desire more. I have always wondered about my financial freedom journey; Would I actually stop when I hit that FIRE number? or will be like many capitalists, continue on and accumulate wealth until I can't anymore. Hopefully, when that day comes I stick to my principals and choose the path which would lead to long-lasting happiness
