Buddhism is generally considered a non-theistic religion, meaning it does not emphasize the worship of a personal deity or deities. The teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha, center around understanding and overcoming suffering through the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. The Buddha did not encourage the worship of a higher power, as he emphasized individual responsibility for one's actions and the pursuit of enlightenment through self-realization.

However, as Buddhism spread to various cultures and regions, local traditions and beliefs sometimes incorporated deities and supernatural beings. These might include bodhisattvas, celestial beings, or figures from local folklore. In some Buddhist cultures, people may engage in devotional practices that involve offering respect or reverence to these beings.

It's important to distinguish between the core teachings of Buddhism, which focus on the path to enlightenment and the cessation of suffering, and the cultural or regional variations that may include elements of worship or devotion to deities. Different Buddhist traditions may have diverse interpretations and practices, leading to variations in the perception of deities within the broader framework of Buddhist philosophy.


No, the historical Shakyamuni Buddha did not advocate worship of himself or of anyone or anything else. He encourages an ethical, harmless life and meditation to understand, for oneself, the nature and origins of suffering, the fact that we can be free from suffering, and the actions to take to do what he had done to become free of suffering. He emphasized that he was a person like any other, and any person could do what he had done, and do it even without a teacher such as himself. In Buddhism, teachers are useful, but not essential. Shakyamuni found his way without a teacher, and each of us can, too.

In the earliest sutras, there is encouragement to revere, or respect, elders and teachers including the Buddha. This refers to not being insulting or dismissive. It is not suggesting worship.


This is a universal human phenomena .

The Buddha taught philosophy and the vast majority of people are neither interested in philosophy nor do they have the capacity to understand and integrate the concepts.

Most people are interested in dealing their daily trials and tribulations and spend very little intellectual energy on pondering upon the meaning of life and existentialism.

So in their pursuit of solace and assistance they turn to gods and buddhas and make offerings and recite prayers and supplications.

Rather than worshipping the Buddha they should study and apply his teachings. So for a person grieving over the death of a loved one – telling them that death is inevitable and unavoidable and that they too will die so there is no point in grieving and that they should just get over it – will not alleviate their suffering.

One would have thought that the doctrine of KARMA would have solved all problems - our present suffering and losses are due to our past actions so we should just accept them stoically and keep moving ahead. Philosophers will easily accept this but the majority do not, and seek to bargain with the spiritual forces to be given a reprieve.

Most people do not convert to another religion because they are persuaded by the theological and philosophical arguments presented - they convert in the hope and expectation that their new god will answer their prayers.
