Bhagavat Geetha -What is yours today, belonged to someone else yesterday


An issue was brought up to me and caused me to refledct on my own self choices. This person was also after financial freedom and he thinks has become a shell of his former self. He explains how the pursuit of financial freedom caused his entire life to revolve around his business, getting new clients, keeping clients happy, making more money, etc. He has become more anxious and stressed about losing the wealth he has, the business he created. He talked about how when he was younger he was much more self-assured, confident, and unphased. Now that is older, he's finding that he has much more to lose and it's causing him to always be in a state of panic.


This 40-year-olds put to words a lot of things that sometimes creep into my mind. Will my pursuit of FIRE which was to free up my time for hobbies and interests be the exact same thing that will take up all my time. With this question, I would have to go back to the teaching of Siddhartha Gautama the Buddha. 



The way I see it, to some degree: power, certainty, good health, possessions; all these things are just an illusion and are only temporary.  Instead of thinking of these things as things we own, think of it as we are only caretakers for a short time. That new house, my friends and family, my good health, that confidence I have, are not really mine. I am simply a caretaker of these things for a certain amount of time before it gets passed on. Eventually, my new house will go to someone else, my family will pass, and my good health will decline. This may seem all depressing, but it's fine. Once you realize you truly never possessed anything, how can you ever lose anything? You will look at things and events differently. All these are temporary gifts and you will appreciate them all as they come and once they are gone. One day I will achieve FIRE and finally build the life I dream of. But I will always remember I do not own this life. The universe has simplified allowed me to achieve such a state, but there is no guarantee for tomorrow. If FIRE is not mine, why would I be sad since I am losing nothing?
