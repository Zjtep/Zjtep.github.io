Bhagavat Geetha -What is yours today, belonged to someone else yesterday

The way I see it, to some degree: power, certainty, good health, possessions; all these things are just an illusion and are only temporary.  Instead of thinking of these things as things we own, think of it as we are only caretakers for a short time. That new house, my family, my good health, that new knowledge I learned, are not really mine. I am simply a caretaker of these things for a certain amount of time before it gets passed on. Eventually, my new house will go to someone else, my family will pass, and my good health will decline. This may seem all depressing, but it's fine. Once you realize you truly never possessed anything, how can you ever lose anything? You look at things differently. All these are temporary gifts and you will appreciate them all as they come and once they are gone, you will be fine. One day I will achieve FIRE and finally build the life I dream of. But I will always remember I do not own this life. The universe has simplified allowed me to achieve such a state, but there is no guarantee for tomorrow. if it is not mine, I can not lose it.
